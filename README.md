# 👋 Hello, I’m Umair Shakoor

Welcome to my GitHub 👋  
I’m a **System Builder in progress** — focused on turning **raw business problems** into **reliable, scalable software systems**.

I don’t chase stacks.  
I build **outcomes**.

---

## 🧠 What I Actually Do

I work at the intersection of:
- ⚙️ System thinking
- 🌐 Modern web platforms
- 🔐 Reliability, data integrity & scalability
- 🎯 Business-first problem solving

My goal is simple:
> Take a vague idea or pain → design the flow → build the system → make it work in the real world.

---

## 🧩 Core Stack (Depth > Hype)

These are the tools I’m going **deep** into:

![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next.js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=nextdotjs&logoColor=white)
![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-316192?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React_(Foundations)-61DAFB?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=black)
![React Native](https://img.shields.io/badge/React_Native-61DAFB?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=white)
![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind_CSS-38B2AC?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)
![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)

> React is a foundation.  
> Next.js is where real systems live.  
> React Native lets me **go mobile** without losing system consistency.

## 🏗️ What You’ll Find Here

- 🧱 **System-oriented projects** (not toy apps)
- 🔄 Rebuilt projects (tutorial → independent → AI-assisted)
- 🧪 Experiments around scalability, structure & UX
- 📂 Demo systems used for real business discussions

This GitHub is a **workshop**, not a highlight reel.

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Deep mastery of **TypeScript**
- Building **production-style systems** with Next.js
- Strong **data modeling** with PostgreSQL
- Thinking in **flows, failure cases, and tradeoffs**
- Using AI as an **assistant**, not a crutch

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Direction

- Build internal tools, SaaS platforms & custom systems
- Move from “developer” → **problem owner**
- Launch and own systems, not just ship code
